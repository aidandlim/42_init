# Example 07 : 
#       Figure out the PID of the SSHD service.
#
# Note :
#       PID meaning the process ID of the process.
#       Two ways, If you want to get the PID only
#       (1) run the command : systemctl status ssh | grep " PID" | awk '{print $3}'
#       (2) run the command ps (short for process status, displaying currently-running processes, real-time view)
#           aux for the a argument lets ps show processes of all users instead of only the current user.

ps aux | grep sshd | awk 'FNR == 1' | awk '{print $2}'
