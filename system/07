# Example : 
#       Figure out the PID of the SSHD service.
#
# Note :
#       PID meaning the process ID of the process.
#       Two ways, If you want to get the PID only
#       run the command systemctl status ssh command then grep " PID" | awk '{print $3}'
#       ----------------when you want more------------------------------------
#       but you can also do it by running the command ps (short for process status),
#       displaying currently-running processes, real-time view
#       -----------------------why aux----------------------------------------
#       -aux for the a argument lets ps show processes of all users instead of only the current user, if the processes are connected to a terminal.
#       The x makes ps also include processes which are not connected to any terminal in the list. So the ax together causes ps to list all processes without restriction.
#       The u simply changes the output formatting and visible columns.

ps aux | grep "ssh" | awk 'FNR == 1'
#systemctl status ssh | grep " PID" | awk '{print $3}'
