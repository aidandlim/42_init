# Example : 
#       Find the service which makes it possible to run specific tasks following a regular schedule
#
# Note :
#       cron is a system service that runs in the background,checks for scheduled tasks, and executes them if it finds any.
#       The tasks -called "cron jobs"- are defined in special configuration files (crontabs)
#       crons scans crontabs every minute to check for scheduled tasks.
#       "Crontabs" are like your computer's calendar
#       you can use command crontab -e to edit the crontabs and add a scheduled task
#       to edit root or other users' crontabs, run the command with admin privileges and add -u option for user name
#       syntax : sudo crontab -u root -e
