# Example : 
#       Find the service which makes it possible to run specific tasks following a regular schedule
#
# Note :
#       cron is a system service that runs in the background, checks for scheduled tasks, and executes them if it finds any.
#       "Crontabs" are like your computer's calendar
#       you can use command crontab -e to edit the crontabs and add a scheduled task
#       to edit root or other users' crontabs, run the command with admin privileges and add -u option for user name
#       syntax : crontab -u root -e
#       example : * * * * * cat /home/dlim/Desktop/42_init/system/16 > /home/dlim/Desktop/cron
