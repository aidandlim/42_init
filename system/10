# Example : 
#       Name the command that lists the partition tables of drives?
#
# Note :
#       there is 4 ways to do this!! 4!!
#       lsblk : lists all the block devices of your system along with their logical partitions (for this you do not need to be in the root!)
#       fdisk -l : fdisk stands for format-disk or Fixed-disk it's used to create or delete hard disk partitions
#       if you use the -l option it shows the partition table then exit
#       sfdisk -l /dev/sda : primarily used to manipulate partition tables on linux but can also list with the syntax
#       or....try parted/dev/sda you will get into the "parted" prompt type unit GB or TB and then type print
#       you can use parted -l too.

fdisk -l
