# Example : 
#       Name the command that lists the partition tables of drives?
#
# Note :
#       There is a lot of ways to do this one
#       (1) fdisk -l : fdisk stands for format-disk or Fixed-disk it's used to create or delete hard disk partitions
#                      if you use the -l option it shows the partition table
#       (2) lsblk : lists all the block devices of your system along with their logical partitions
#       (3) sfdisk -l /dev/sda : primarily used to manipulate partition tables on linux but can also list with the syntax
#       (4) you can use parted -l too.

fdisk -l
