# Example : 
#       Figure out the exact size of each folder of /var in a humanly understandable way followed by the path of it.
#
# Note :
#       du : "disk usage"
#       -s for summarization since the requried form is just the size of each forlder of /var
#       -h for human readable form

du -sh /var/*
