# Example : 
#       What file contains the RSA keys of systems that are authorized to connect via SSH?
#
# Note :
#       RSA key, a private key based on RSA algorithm, used for authentication and a symmetric key exchange
#       during extablishment of an SSL/TLS session
#       --------how the key set is used--------------
#       the public key is added to a special file within the user account you will be logging into
#       It is stored in the file called authorized_keys which is located in the .ssh folder if it has one.
#       -------------------but!----------------------
#       I did not generated a ssh key pair yet so there is nothing in the .ssh directory, but if I generate a key pair in the future with ssh-keygen
#       it will be stored in

~/.ssh/authorized_keys
