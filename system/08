# Example 08 : 
#       What file contains the RSA keys of systems that are authorized to connect via SSH?
#
# Note :
#       RSA key, a private key based on RSA algorithm, used for authentication and a symmetric key exchange during extablishment of an SSL/TLS session
#       the public key is added to a special file within the user account you will be logging into
#       It is stored in the file called authorized_keys which is located in the .ssh folder if it has one.
#       I did not generated a ssh key pair yet so there is nothing in the .ssh directory.
#       but if I generate a key pair with ssh-keygen, it will be stored in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
