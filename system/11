# Example 11 : 
#       Name the command that displays the available space left and used on the system in an humanly understandable way
#
# Note :
#       df : "disk filesystem" with this command user can display the amount of available space for file systems
#       on which the invoking user has appropriate read access.
#       -h will show the file system disk space statistics in "human readable" format
#       -H also prints sizes in human readable format but! use powers of 1000 not 1024 so used size will increase

df -h
