# Example : 
#       Find the command that kills the background commandâ€™s process
#
# Note :
#       how do you kill a job?
#       you can kill a job by using command kill with the PID of the job
#       how do you determine the PID?
#       use command : jobs -l and it will list the jobs and it's details including PID
#       or use command : ps, ps reports a snapshot of the current processes
#       when process isn't responding to the term signal (which allows the process to do a final clean up before quitting)
#       go for the KILL signal(which doesn't let process do any clean up)

kill %pid
