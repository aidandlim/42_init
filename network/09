# Example : 
#       Find the external IP of 42.fr
#
# Expected output : 
#       163.172.250.12
#       163.172.250.13
#
# Note :
#       The IP address converted by the domain name by the utility host is the external IP addresses.
#       Home and business networks use private or internal addresses from a reserved non route-able address range so the address we were given is the external IP address.
#       --------just useful tip use FNR you can count the rows!------------------
#       host 42.fr | grep address | awk '{print $4}'
