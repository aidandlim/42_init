# Example : 
#       Thanks to the previous question and the reverse DNS find the name of your host
#
# Expected output : 
#       e1z2r3p36.42.us.org
#
# Note :
#       the command I used for this is host, host if put in a domain name gives an IP address if address gives a domain name 
#       host [IP address] | awk '{print$5}'
