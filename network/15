# Example : 
#       Make the intra.42.fr address reroute to 46.19.122.85
#
# Note :
#       Rerouting an IP address to a domain can be done by editing your hosts file
#       but in this case the permission is denied due to sudo rights.
#       If it is performed correctly to add the following line 46.19.122.85 intra.42.fr
#
#       then cat /etc/hosts
#
#       127.0.0.1       localhost
#       255.255.255.255 broadcasthost
#       ::1             localhost
#
#       #10.51.1.38 	cdn.intra.42.fr
#       127.0.0.1       e1z2r6p4.42.fr
#       45.19.122.85	intra.42.fr
#
#       is expected.
