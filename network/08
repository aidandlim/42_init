# Example : 
#       Find the provider of slash16.org
#
# Expected output : 
#       Amazon.com, Inc.
#
# Note :
#       first identify the IP address, you can use the command 'host' or the command 'nslookup'
#       now if you have the IP address you can use it to find the provider with the 'whois' command.
#       If you whois the IP address it shows that the organization is
#       Amazon.com, Inc.
