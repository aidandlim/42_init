# Example : 
#       Identifiy the default gateway in the routing table
#
# Expected output : 
#       default            10.112.254.254     UGSc          108        0     en0
#
# Note :
#       network statistics -r to get the routing table
#       default one is the first one.
#       if you use r the result never ends. 
#       please use -nr (all it does is convert address in to numbers but it ends the process as well)
