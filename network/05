# Example : 
#       Identify the IP address of the DNS that responds to the following url: slash16.org
#
# Expected output : 
#       Server:         10.51.1.253
#       Address:        10.51.1.253#53
#
#       Non-authoritative answer:
#       Name:   slash16.org
#       Address: 99.84.231.140
#       Name:   slash16.org
#       Address: 99.84.231.92
#       Name:   slash16.org
#       Address: 99.84.231.195

# Note :
#       DNS the domain name system.
#       DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load internet resources
#       Internet Protocol has different versions, IPv4 is (version 4) and is in dotted 
#       -decimal notation. One byte = Eight bits, thirty - two bits(4*8), or 4 bytes]
#       IPv4 is running out of unique IP addresses, so IPv6 replaces it. 16 byte = 128bits each.
#       --------------------What is nslookup----------------------
#       a program to query internet domain name servers.
#       two modes: interactive, non-interactive. 
#       Interactive mode allows the user to query name servers for information about various hosts and domains or to print a list of hosts in a domain. 
#       Non-interactive mode is used to print just the names and requested information for a host or domain.
