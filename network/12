# Example : 
#       Find the IP that was assigned to you by dhcp server
#
# Expected output : 
#
# Note :
#       <DHCP> Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
#       When your machine is connected to the internet (when a client joins the network)
#       it automatically provides and assigns IP addresses.
#       so.....how does this work for my computer
#       When the computer is connected to the internet by ethernet (en0) the DHCP Server
#       assigns a IP address.

ifconfig en0 | grep "inet " | awk '{print $2}'
